The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk.

Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)The delicious meal San Francisco.

The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone!

However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever.

Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point! Fog Harbor one best experiences visiting San Francisco. We made reservation one week prime dinner times available, still got good time waited little sit window (so pretty)!This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge. Our waitress tried make neglecting us initially throwing couple extra sourdough rolls go..it helped. Good place overall, patience wait fight crowds tourists.This place delicious cioppino clam chowder. Cioppino seafood stew originated San Francisco first time trying I loved it. Their cioppino red sauce plenty seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce strong tomato garlic taste little bit spicy, overall taste harmonious.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting.

Soft afternoon light settled white table cloth plates, giving warm yet fancy atmosphere. We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!!

We waited awhile order informed server ready. Long wait, horrible service food. We got crab cocktail calamari starter. I highly recommend crab cocktail. It shredded crab delicious. Calamari ok. So I got two lobster tails $58. I thought two perfect favorite, however extremely!!!! Salty, taste good all. I told sever also informed I wanna wait another 20 minutes food.

They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever.

Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)The delicious meal San Francisco.

Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BCelebrating friend's birthday. Actually first time here, came around 6pm, wait. We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine. There bit wait even reservation. Decent sake wine selection. Went lunch Friday celebrate graduation. I really surprised see busy noon !! Definitely recommend reservations. Food delicious! We calamari, variety salmon dishes, lobster roll, sort bleu cheese appetizer. Drinks great well.Visiting Chicago. Relied Yelp recommendations find Fog Harbor Fish House.

We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point!

Overall, fine dining Asian fusion homey feeling restaurant delivers! I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant.

We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine. There bit wait even reservation. Decent sake wine selection. Went lunch Friday celebrate graduation. I really surprised see busy noon !! Definitely recommend reservations. Food delicious! We calamari, variety salmon dishes, lobster roll, sort bleu cheese appetizer. Drinks great well.Visiting Chicago. Relied Yelp recommendations find Fog Harbor Fish House.

Sourdough bread warm soft.Clam chowder clammy generous portions clam meat.Lazy cippino fresh seafood (deshelled crabmeat, mussels, clams, shrimps) scrumptous broth toasted garlic bread soak juices.Apple crisp crispy top warm gooey apple slices bottom, topped vanilla ice cream.All all, ashamed tourists tourist spot best seafood best view offer.Extra shoutout server Jane. She welcoming, kind, positive attitude. She took care table took pictures us smile. Felt bad got stiffed dingy tip neighbor table appeared foreign visitors.

My husband garlic roasted crab I cioppino. Both good. Can't go wrong here. Ended coffee frangelica whip cream. Yum!!!We back next visit!This place pretty good, pricey (as expected restaurant pier). We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point! Fog Harbor one best experiences visiting San Francisco. We made reservation one week prime dinner times available, still got good time waited little sit window (so pretty)!This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge. Our waitress tried make neglecting us initially throwing couple extra sourdough rolls go..it helped. Good place overall, patience wait fight crowds tourists.This place delicious cioppino clam chowder. Cioppino seafood stew originated San Francisco first time trying I loved it. Their cioppino red sauce plenty seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce strong tomato garlic taste little bit spicy, overall taste harmonious. The award winning clam chowder creamy bread bowl sour dough bread tasted better piece garlic beard came cioppino. On top delicious seafood, service great. Our server nice friendly. One tip avoid wait join Yelp waitlist. We arrived couple minutes designated check time table ready promptly.Very busy location, asked party members present order seated. We bigger group 6 people.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting. For main dishes, I'd recommend Linguine & Clams Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, shrimp). The seafood fresh tasting sauces dishes really tasty. Overall, happy full!At really good location, enjoy view pier eating. Bread chowder good!

Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing.

Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!!

I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk. To super safe, paid garage UC College Law couple blocks down.Service always attentive importantly talented staff pleasing eyes! The staff usually wear red lunch black dinner.dont know post photosBirthday dinner boyfriend. Arrived reservations got seated right away. Off bat. It big restaurant pretty empty first arrived.

Overall, fine dining Asian fusion homey feeling restaurant delivers! I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk. To super safe, paid garage UC College Law couple blocks down.Service always attentive importantly talented staff pleasing eyes! The staff usually wear red lunch black dinner.dont know post photosBirthday dinner boyfriend. Arrived reservations got seated right away. Off bat. It big restaurant pretty empty first arrived.

Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)The delicious meal San Francisco.

Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BCelebrating friend's birthday. Actually first time here, came around 6pm, wait. We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine.

She welcoming, kind, positive attitude. She took care table took pictures us smile. Felt bad got stiffed dingy tip neighbor table appeared foreign visitors. She deserved tip praise manager.The men's bathroom closed temporarily cleaning dinner hours, perhaps due "incident."Had great time. Jane server attentive!! She great job. My husband garlic roasted crab I cioppino. Both good. Can't go wrong here. Ended coffee frangelica whip cream. Yum!!!We back next visit!This place pretty good, pricey (as expected restaurant pier). We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point! Fog Harbor one best experiences visiting San Francisco. We made reservation one week prime dinner times available, still got good time waited little sit window (so pretty)!This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge. Our waitress tried make neglecting us initially throwing couple extra sourdough rolls go..it helped. Good place overall, patience wait fight crowds tourists.This place delicious cioppino clam chowder. Cioppino seafood stew originated San Francisco first time trying I loved it. Their cioppino red sauce plenty seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce strong tomato garlic taste little bit spicy, overall taste harmonious. The award winning clam chowder creamy bread bowl sour dough bread tasted better piece garlic beard came cioppino. On top delicious seafood, service great. Our server nice friendly. One tip avoid wait join Yelp waitlist. We arrived couple minutes designated check time table ready promptly.Very busy location, asked party members present order seated. We bigger group 6 people. We missed one guy, late 30 min, nice host let us in. Maybe reservation early like 5pm. lot people waiting outside. Definitely reservation go.I remember got crab cake, done perfectly.

Service great, seafood good.For appetizer, I would 100% recommend famous clam chowder -- offering topped fresh crab, take offer...it really game changer! Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting. For main dishes, I'd recommend Linguine & Clams Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, shrimp). The seafood fresh tasting sauces dishes really tasty. Overall, happy full!At really good location, enjoy view pier eating. Bread chowder good! Especially chewiness, shell platter rich, fresh tasty, definitely worth price!Also, thanks Jane sweet reminding, protected shirt, attentive service!2/16/2019My daughter home college birthday weekend. She always wants see bay ocean comes home, make point that. We made reservations week advance, parked parking structure across Pier39 arrived right time. TIP: Make reservation, place popular gets busy, fast. Our server wonderful! So funny attentive. We ordered seafood tower, lobster roll son like shellfish got cheeseburger. We terrific lunch. Everything fresh delicious. We definitely back future.Had divine dinner family last night I really meant I said meal DIVINE; really splurged meal .On second floor Pier 39, restaurant overlooks waterfront area. Soft afternoon light settled white table cloth plates, giving warm yet fancy atmosphere. We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!! There delicious wok smokiness made impossible stop going back more.Again, I divine meal last night would definitely reccommend anyone area come check amazing place out.That scallop risotto though. Best ever. The scallops perfectly cooked melted mouth. The sauce perfectly made went well risotto crab well light pesto sauce. I party 4 2 us ordered risotto 4 us loved get enough it. It filling well. We also bread bowl addition Dungeness crab. Usually bread bowls fully cut bread bowl gutted out. One better bread bowls I've ever had. The service good too.

The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function.

We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine. There bit wait even reservation. Decent sake wine selection. Went Went lunch Friday celebrate graduation. I really surprised see busy noon !! Definitely recommend reservations. Food delicious! We calamari, variety salmon dishes, lobster roll, sort bleu cheese appetizer. Drinks great well.Visiting Chicago. Relied Yelp recommendations find Fog Harbor Fish House.

Sourdough bread warm soft.Clam chowder clammy generous portions clam meat.Lazy cippino fresh seafood (deshelled crabmeat, mussels, clams, shrimps) scrumptous broth toasted garlic bread soak juices.Apple crisp crispy top warm gooey apple slices bottom, topped vanilla ice cream.All all, ashamed tourists tourist spot best seafood best view offer.Extra shoutout server Jane. She welcoming, kind, positive attitude. She took care table took pictures us smile. Felt bad got stiffed dingy tip neighbor table appeared foreign visitors. She deserved tip praise manager.The men's bathroom closed temporarily cleaning dinner hours, perhaps due "incident."Had great time. Jane server attentive!! She great job. My husband garlic roasted crab I cioppino. Both good. Can't go wrong here. Ended coffee frangelica whip cream. Yum!!!We back next visit!This place pretty good, pricey (as expected restaurant pier). We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point! Fog Harbor one best experiences visiting San Francisco. We made reservation one week prime dinner times available, still got good time waited little sit window (so pretty)!This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge. Our waitress tried make neglecting us initially throwing couple extra sourdough rolls go..it helped. Good place overall, patience wait fight crowds tourists.This place delicious cioppino clam chowder. Cioppino seafood stew originated San Francisco first time trying I loved it. Their cioppino red sauce plenty seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce strong tomato garlic taste little bit spicy, overall taste harmonious. The award winning clam chowder creamy bread bowl sour dough bread tasted better piece garlic beard came cioppino. On top delicious seafood, service great. Our server nice friendly. One tip avoid wait join Yelp waitlist. We arrived couple minutes designated check time table ready promptly.Very busy location, asked party members present order seated. We bigger group 6 people.

Service great, seafood good.For appetizer, I would 100% recommend famous clam chowder -- offering topped fresh crab, take offer...it really game changer! Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting. For main dishes, I'd recommend Linguine & Clams Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, shrimp). The seafood fresh tasting sauces dishes really tasty. Overall, happy full!At really good location, enjoy view pier eating. Bread chowder good! Especially chewiness, shell platter rich, fresh tasty, definitely worth price!Also, thanks Jane sweet reminding, protected shirt, attentive service!2/16/2019My daughter home college birthday weekend.

We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!!

We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine. There bit wait even reservation. Decent sake wine selection. Went lunch Friday celebrate graduation. I really surprised see busy noon !! Definitely recommend reservations. Food delicious! We calamari, variety salmon dishes, lobster roll, sort bleu cheese appetizer. Drinks great well.The clam chowder savory delicious. I wished cans! The garlic crab okay. The crab cooked much butter me.

She deserved tip praise manager.The men's bathroom closed temporarily cleaning dinner hours, perhaps due "incident."This place pretty good, pricey (as expected restaurant pier). We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.We came boyfriend's family visiting figured would great reviews since touristy area. We surprised good food service was. The portions also big (even sharing plate) everyone liked got. We added spice garlic noodles Lazy cioppino would definitely recommend!Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point! Fog Harbor one best experiences visiting San Francisco. We made reservation one week prime dinner times available, still got good time waited little sit window (so pretty)!This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge. Our waitress tried make neglecting us initially throwing couple extra sourdough rolls go..it helped. Good place overall, patience wait fight crowds tourists.This place delicious cioppino clam chowder. Cioppino seafood stew originated San Francisco first time trying I loved it. Their cioppino red sauce plenty seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce strong tomato garlic taste little bit spicy, overall taste harmonious.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting. For main dishes, I'd recommend Linguine & Clams Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, shrimp). The seafood fresh tasting sauces dishes really tasty. Overall, happy full!2/16/2019My daughter home college birthday weekend. She always wants see bay ocean comes home, make point that.

Soft afternoon light settled white table cloth plates, giving warm yet fancy atmosphere. We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!! There delicious wok smokiness made impossible stop going back more.Again, I divine meal last night would definitely reccommend anyone area come check amazing place out.That scallop risotto though. Best ever. The scallops perfectly cooked melted mouth. The sauce perfectly made went well risotto crab well light pesto sauce. I party 4 2 us ordered risotto 4 us loved get enough it.

Overall, fine dining Asian fusion homey feeling restaurant delivers! I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantBirthday dinner boyfriend. Arrived reservations got seated right away. Off bat. It big restaurant pretty empty first arrived. It gets packed later reservations would must. We shared octopus appetizer goodness. It tender I loved sauce used. I got sea bass came garlic noodles mini green beans. To honest, I high expectations spot bookmarked years. Pretty disappointed- salted definitely make home. He got ahi tuna liked it. I tried well pretty good. We also got dessert- passion fruit coconut creme brûlée. I liked coconut part passion fruit sauce made dessert very, bitter. I ended scraping sauce finishing dessert. :)Overall, nice restaurant I'm glad I finally tried restaurant. Would back octopus appetizer items menu.is favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk. To super safe, paid garage UC College Law couple blocks down.Service always attentive importantly talented staff pleasing eyes! The staff usually wear red lunch black dinner.dont know post photosThis one favorite meals holiday San Francisco. Born raised Hong Kong, I'm usually skeptical Asian fusion cuisine I quite liked creativity surrounding food here. My friends I made reservation restaurant quite small - even reservation, seat whole party present. We decided share following:Deep Fried Salmon Roll: These rolls really crispy outside! I liked salmon cooked medium rare inside still really soft. This quite big portion starter great sharing.Seared Scallops: These really buttery cooked perfectly. The scallops really succulent.

I'm glad wasabi flavor strong steak really nice I'd probably still try something new next time.Seared Ahi Tuna Rice: This yummy also miss much order this. It's quite big portion tuna steaks cooked perfectly. It's cut thick served medium rare. I really liked sauce went too.Pork Chop, Pomegranate Sauce: Usually fan pork chops I've let dry rough ones pork chop really tender flavorful. Loved pomegranate sauce too!For dessert, ordered mango tapioca chocolate cake. Both yummy! The mango tapioca like Cantonese dessert, mango sago, except creamier thicker.Overall, everything delicious well fed group five. The price bit steep negative, worth splurge especially visitor SF!I've dying try The House long time I finally got try lunch!The space small clean attention detail interesting artwork, attentive friendly staff, little house detail paper table setting. Funny detail: mirror bathroom, mirror towards entrance.Here's ordered:Demon Slayer Sake shot - I definitely ordered name. The flavor notes exactly described: fruity, honey notes. I'd get again, probably full bottle. Phoenix Oolong tea - The kettle cute hard work with. The tea great refilled kettle us needed it.Fried Salmon Roll - Pure, juicy salmon wrapped nori fried served wasabi sauce kimchi. SUPER tasty last bite. We kept sauce eat rest meal.Wasabi Noodles w/ Grilled Kurobota Pork - The wasabi harsh dish, noodles great chew, pork grilled juicy perfection. Loved every noodly bite.Sea Bass - How many times I use word "juicy"? This juicy buttery green beans great accompaniment.Such great meal! There single component I like thought 'meh.' I would definitely eat again, I'm interested rest menu would like try dinner.One favorite places eat North Beach. I stick Seabass I absolutely adore fish done right boy place right. Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)Four us great time House! I able make reservation day two advance, seated right away arrived.

For price. I've total 3 times incredible meal time. You cannot go wrong seafood. Just get sea bass happy....highly recommend.Came good bye dinner friends. Tiny little spot hidden away North Beach. Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BLooked great tasted okay. Beef flavorless tough. Noodles good, can't compare traditional hand made noodles. Pork ribs cooked. Dry tough candied shell. The sauce pretty good BBQ/Asian combo.The black cod good also lacked flavor wasabi overpowered dish. Mango sago best part meal, I mean possibly mess up...Lemonade watered sourSmall popular place directly Chinatown. Judging photos, thought place would super frills surprisingly cozy intimate. We made reservation calling seated lovely host, although wait bit upon arrival (makes sense, small). I would describe cuisine Asian fusion. Our server gem gave many awesome recommendations, shared 4-5 specials night. For 3 people, server suggested sharing: Wasabi Noodles (side) - 5/5 must order noodle fan- great wasabi taste overpoweringFried Salmon Rolls - 3/5 I personally like salmon raw/rare one cooked since deep fried...Manilla Clams - 4.5/5 I loved dish! Very flavorfulPoke app (special) - 3.5/5 regular poke avocado wasabi flairUni App - 5/5 much like eel sushi roll much better. Very unique hit. Overall, I would definitely return everything great here, especially like wasabi flavors seafood things!This place good worth crazy wait. Came I noticed line short 20mins wait time. Sometimes I think people see line think "oh must worth wait!" IMHO wait 45mins hour+ favor find somewhere else eat. The hakata style ramen good hits spot. There's option chicken leg I think that's popular option worth money. I got regular hakata tonkatsu ramen delicious! Came egg, chaushu, usual veg (sprouts scallions).Delicious, slightly overrated, ramen staple Japantown. Make sure get deluxe ramen, miss thick cut pork belly. Seriously, I'd inject bloodstream I could.Also, prepared wait. Unless show restaurant opens, quite ways back waitlist.Meh meh meh...overhyped. Waitlist system awesome. I think Chinese company owns ramen spots Japan. Hinodeya Mugizo well beginning Japanese staff, Filipino Chinese. Maybe training off.Firm hakata skinny noodles quite doughy still. Noodles bland broths much depth oily, thin broth coat noodles I would say. Tonkotsu Paiten tastes same. The spice levels makes difference changes broth. We 3, spicy, medium, spicy. I tried tell pork chicken. No spicy tonkotsu looks like paiten ramen spots specialize paiten. Chashu, kakuni, nothing special all. Chicken breast tender. Worst rice bowls. Japanese noodle places always high end side dons premium koshihikari rice Japan. This pathetic annoying cheap calrose even short grain jasmine looking even exists. And wet, wtf, measured? Mentaiko seasoned mixture natural whole pieces, stupid flavor even tastes like mentaiko. It's expensive mix shit get miles it. Karaage sticky gelatinous texture salty flavors. Bland again. The salad Ramune best. Service lacking. Food came time. With small ass table, imagine frustration. About squeeze lemon karaage fucking ramen shows shut fuck eat ramen right away. Ramen rule last thing come. Wake up. Did I need order karaage salad first order ramen I ready? It obvious. Again, Japanese culture here. Should went Benihana Emperor's Feast Samurai Treat, mistakes teppanyaki. Or Steve Aoki's dad Rocky's Choice. SF Bay Area - favorites Santouka Ippudo consistent accurate time. Halu best noodles, go ramen waste time. It's yakitori, order bunch "skewers" still hungry ramen.Came weekday afternoon. It 15 minutes opening dinner (5:30pm) already long line formed. Fortunately, group 5 able seated right away. Service quick fast-paced without feeling rushed. I starter shishito peppers blistered nicely went perfectly thin sweet soy sauce served with. My kid got karaage chicken. Flavor slightly different, otherwise typical good chicken karaage.. The side rice ordered slightly wet. I ordered tonkatsu XD. OMG.. broth creamy, salty (in good way), flavorful. So delicious. The egg perfectly soft boiled sweet pork belly Chashu tender flavorful. So frikkin yummy. Served thin ramen noodles. MMm yummy! The decor setup clean. No restroom restaurant, must use public restrooms Japan center.OOH Marufuku, far thin noodle place I've I've ACTUALLY liked. And I felt worth wait. And also, somehow, incredibly, worth $16?! All all, great bowl ramen.First things first: get EARLY. Their waitlist opens EXACTLY 11:30 closes 12:00 FULL. If line one first ~20 people so, whip phone put name waitlist ASAP.Now. Onto ramen itself. I got tonkotsu DX, extra kakuni, nori, corn make well worth it. The broth *extremely* rich, pairs well super melty braised pork refreshing crunchy corn. My brother got chicken paitan girlfriend regular tonkotsu, said wished got DX. Plus, often going wait line ramen? Get deluxe.It also bears mentioning DO veggie ramen request loaded vegetables similarly rich broth. It looked amazing.Small things I like really push 5 stars:1. Despite really crowded, run tight ship gently nudge door. Maybe might like it, people selfish.2. They send everyone away they're full. The waitlist closed one waiting anymore time seated. I'm glad dont leave hanging like Orenchi joints cant serve you. It's nice sign respect.3. Their lime lemon / mint spa water delicious cuts otherwise mega rich broth super well.Overall great bowl ramen willing endure wait. Definitely worth checking out.---Sweet: lives hype! Super rich broth, firm noodles. Fast, efficient service Bitter: wait (of course!)If get early wait less 30 min. They crank goodOverall ramen well average holy grail. The. thick slice pork good I almost liked thin noodles Skip Karaage. But get Marufuku BitesHands best ramen SF. wanting try place long never went long lines. I finally decided go Friday dinner arrived 30 minutes opened there's already line. We lucky get Chicken Paitan dx, around 15 servings day. I still remember pleasant smell chicken came sizzling hot plate. It's juicy savory smoky - can't ask better savory dish. The ramen also amazing soup flavorful.Price fair I would definitely want back another time. Maybe weekday wait shorter.Had Hakata Ramen. There's nothing wrong ramen personally didnt taste anything special good I yesterday I would come East Bay wait line it... thankfully I I happened passing wait line since I early. The ramen alright nothing rave about. Soup savory good thing hot warm that's I still gave 3 star. Ramen personal preference try yourself. But me, something I would return for.They short simple menu four choices ramen. Tried Hakata ramen. Hakata ramen known rich, cloudy milky pork bone broth. I impressed rich savory broth here. The noodles thin Hakata style noodles. Since they're thin, get soft easily. I eat pretty slow, get less firm chewy I neared end.Although ramen delicious, still worth 50 minute wait. I came weekend evening, put name Yelp waitlist, headed out. I actively wait place. If business things getting called in, definitely worth try.Here's thing Marufuku Ramen SF.*I actually dined back unable complete review now.In total - know want - entire dining experience completed ~20 minutes. This negative aspect restaurant. Quite contrary - I put name ~10 minutes opened. Sat 20 minutes later, within 5-10 minutes got food.There's something special place. Not meal brought quickly, also delicious. I'm expert Ramen, fact I find concept recent ramen craze little silly; however, Marufuku Ramen SF hands favorite ramen bay area.HAKATA TONKOTSUIMO, Ramen really comes broth. It's savory, there's touch earthy-game-y-ness really makes dish. The noodles cooked perfectly acutroumonts round dish.Yelp jokes aside, is, "As good gets!"We talkin bout broth? We talkin bout flavor? Easily one best I've USA (my ramen standards based country since Japan's ramen pedestal). I got tonkotsu ramen flavor amazing. You see fat oils pork floating top soup. It salty, rich, right. The pork belly remarkable go ramen broth meat. We waited hour got right opened. It worth wait. The line moved fairly fast service good. An easy 5 star experience. If Japan town want super quality ramen, stop further.The Yelp app best friend want dine here. Get name waitlist ASAP (the app requires within 7 miles list). The wait us Friday night (7pm) 110-140 minutes. We told arrive 8:42pm I gotta say, pretty accurate. It gave us time things instead standing front restaurant, waiting called. It's fairly small place I understand extremely long wait, especially larger parties dining. I'm guessing place fits 30-40 diners time.What ordered:- Takoyaki: I'm huge fan general decent, sauce overpowering.- Geso Fry: fried squid mayo dipping sauce! Or least I think mayo. Not crispy I usually like fried squid.- Chicken Karaage: blow minds fried well- Hakata Tonkotsu (mild, corn): broth rich hot, I feel vital part delicious ramen. The ramen noodle wow me, thinner I'm used (not traditional ramen noodles I'm use to) cooked well.- Hakata Tonkotsu DX (medium): thick cut pork belly makes soup much richer medium spice changes taste compared regular hakata tonkotsu. Equally delicious, bigger kick former.Service great, handed menus water seated attentive wanted water. The food decently priced well ($12.99 Hakata Tonkotsu $16.99 DX). Definitely give try!**Before I dive 3-star review Marufuku, let preface saying I Japanese self-proclaimed ramen snob. Having grown eating lot good ramen Tokyo, I VERY high expectations.** I came 11:10 Tuesday bc Hinodeya street closed I really craving ramen. There already line 15-20 people waiting I arrived! The line moved pretty quickly doors opened I seated promptly after. I hurriedly placed order Chicken Paitan Dx (since there's 15-meal limit per day) slice pork kakuni side bc I feeling particularly gluttonous also wanted taste Tonkotsu Dx. The meal came 5-10 min placing order everything looked great...but greatness really stopped there, unfortunately. The star player Paitan Dx, grilled chicken leg, quite tasty bold distinctive herbal flavors, ramen reeeally nothing special. The thin noodles slightly cooked broth oily bland lacked depth. (I ordered mine medium spicy I could taste chili.) The kakuni cold tough tender fatty/juicy like pork belly kakuni traditional Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. The redeeming factor sad lunch staff welcoming, friendly wonderful! The food definitely 3 stars level service closer 5 stars. All all, however, experience disappointing, especially since I spent 20 min waiting line mediocre bowl "ramen". I understand people queue this... For $26 meal tip, very, subpar. :(This might BEST ramen I United States. Loved chicken paitan (reminds famous place I've tried Tokyo - Kagari Ramen Ginza). The broth rich creamy chicken tender. Hakata tonakatsu good too, chicken paitan way go! Make sure get yelp waitlist soon open - I joined waitlist upon arriving restaurant waited 2 hours. Obviously would prefer shorter wait, even 2 hours, food well worth it.I always wait hour line food, I - Marufuku Ramen.I got hour place opened Saturday already line 10 people deep. The restaurant inside mall thankfully I exposed elements.After hour began seating. I grew increasingly nervous I saw tables inside (very small) restaurant begin fill up. If sat first seating, we'd probably wait 1 2 hours next seating. Thankfully, made last booth there!We end sharing booth another couple, much preferred waiting next seating. Once inside, energy fast paced. No one leisure. The staff interested turning tables quickly possible, patrons slurp noodles leave.We ordered Hakata Tonkotsu DX ramen Chicken Paitan DX, make 15 day.

Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread.

I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting.

We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!!

Overall, fine dining Asian fusion homey feeling restaurant delivers! I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantBirthday dinner boyfriend. Arrived reservations got seated right away. Off bat. It big restaurant pretty empty first arrived. It gets packed later reservations would must. We shared octopus appetizer goodness. It tender I loved sauce used. I got sea bass came garlic noodles mini green beans. To honest, I high expectations spot bookmarked years. Pretty disappointed- salted definitely make home. He got ahi tuna liked it. I tried well pretty good. We also got dessert- passion fruit coconut creme brûlée. I liked coconut part passion fruit sauce made dessert very, bitter. I ended scraping sauce finishing dessert. :)Overall, nice restaurant I'm glad I finally tried restaurant. Would back octopus appetizer items menu.is favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk. To super safe, paid garage UC College Law couple blocks down.Service always attentive importantly talented staff pleasing eyes! The staff usually wear red lunch black dinner.dont know post photosThis one favorite meals holiday San Francisco. Born raised Hong Kong, I'm usually skeptical Asian fusion cuisine I quite liked creativity surrounding food here.

I really liked sauce went too.Pork Chop, Pomegranate Sauce: Usually fan pork chops I've let dry rough ones pork chop really tender flavorful. Loved pomegranate sauce too!For dessert, ordered mango tapioca chocolate cake. Both yummy! The mango tapioca like Cantonese dessert, mango sago, except creamier thicker.Overall, everything delicious well fed group five. The price bit steep negative, worth splurge especially visitor SF!I've dying try The House long time I finally got try lunch!The space small clean attention detail interesting artwork, attentive friendly staff, little house detail paper table setting. Funny detail: mirror bathroom, mirror towards entrance.Here's ordered:Demon Slayer Sake shot - I definitely ordered name. The flavor notes exactly described: fruity, honey notes.

I would definitely eat again, I'm interested rest menu would like try dinner.One favorite places eat North Beach. I stick Seabass I absolutely adore fish done right boy place right. Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)Four us great time House! I able make reservation day two advance, seated right away arrived. We saw menu decided split appetizers:* Dumplings: good, probably one favorites night!* Grilled octopus: hands-down favorite dish - * Tempura soft-shelled crab: delicious served yummy cold noodles* Clams: great!* Barbecue oysters: huge oysters packed flavor!We ordered entrees offered tastes other:* Wasabi noodles steak: perfectly cooked steak delicious noodles* Mushroom rice prawns: grilled prawns AMAZING; I wish create balanced rice-to-prawn ratio!* Sea bass: I definitely order next time I visit* Salmon: I normally like salmon, fan, definitely get dish, I really enjoyed it!So it. The House really small, intimate restaurant, food comes quickly delicious. At point group feel rushed leave!Deep fried salmon roll ---- 10/10Sashimi------------------8/10Octopus -----------------8/10Sea bass-----------------10/10Flat iron steak------------9/10New York steak (special) --8/10The house favorite restaurant San Francisco. For price. I've total 3 times incredible meal time. You cannot go wrong seafood. Just get sea bass happy....highly recommend.Came good bye dinner friends. Tiny little spot hidden away North Beach. Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BLooked great tasted okay. Beef flavorless tough. Noodles good, can't compare traditional hand made noodles. Pork ribs cooked. Dry tough candied shell. The sauce pretty good BBQ/Asian combo.The black cod good also lacked flavor wasabi overpowered dish. Mango sago best part meal, I mean possibly mess up...Lemonade watered sourSmall popular place directly Chinatown. Judging photos, thought place would super frills surprisingly cozy intimate. We made reservation calling seated lovely host, although wait bit upon arrival (makes sense, small). I would describe cuisine Asian fusion. Our server gem gave many awesome recommendations, shared 4-5 specials night. For 3 people, server suggested sharing: Wasabi Noodles (side) - 5/5 must order noodle fan- great wasabi taste overpoweringFried Salmon Rolls - 3/5 I personally like salmon raw/rare one cooked since deep fried...Manilla Clams - 4.5/5 I loved dish! Very flavorfulPoke app (special) - 3.5/5 regular poke avocado wasabi flairUni App - 5/5 much like eel sushi roll much better. Very unique hit. Overall, I would definitely return everything great here, especially like wasabi flavors seafood things!This place good worth crazy wait. Came I noticed line short 20mins wait time. Sometimes I think people see line think "oh must worth wait!" IMHO wait 45mins hour+ favor find somewhere else eat. The hakata style ramen good hits spot. There's option chicken leg I think that's popular option worth money. I got regular hakata tonkatsu ramen delicious! Came egg, chaushu, usual veg (sprouts scallions).Delicious, slightly overrated, ramen staple Japantown. Make sure get deluxe ramen, miss thick cut pork belly. Seriously, I'd inject bloodstream I could.Also, prepared wait. Unless show restaurant opens, quite ways back waitlist.Meh meh meh...overhyped. Waitlist system awesome. I think Chinese company owns ramen spots Japan. Hinodeya Mugizo well beginning Japanese staff, Filipino Chinese. Maybe training off.Firm hakata skinny noodles quite doughy still. Noodles bland broths much depth oily, thin broth coat noodles I would say. Tonkotsu Paiten tastes same. The spice levels makes difference changes broth. We 3, spicy, medium, spicy. I tried tell pork chicken. No spicy tonkotsu looks like paiten ramen spots specialize paiten. Chashu, kakuni, nothing special all. Chicken breast tender. Worst rice bowls. Japanese noodle places always high end side dons premium koshihikari rice Japan. This pathetic annoying cheap calrose even short grain jasmine looking even exists. And wet, wtf, measured? Mentaiko seasoned mixture natural whole pieces, stupid flavor even tastes like mentaiko. It's expensive mix shit get miles it. Karaage sticky gelatinous texture salty flavors. Bland again. The salad Ramune best. Service lacking. Food came time. With small ass table, imagine frustration. About squeeze lemon karaage fucking ramen shows shut fuck eat ramen right away. Ramen rule last thing come. Wake up. Did I need order karaage salad first order ramen I ready? It obvious. Again, Japanese culture here. Should went Benihana Emperor's Feast Samurai Treat, mistakes teppanyaki. Or Steve Aoki's dad Rocky's Choice. SF Bay Area - favorites Santouka Ippudo consistent accurate time. Halu best noodles, go ramen waste time. It's yakitori, order bunch "skewers" still hungry ramen.Came weekday afternoon. It 15 minutes opening dinner (5:30pm) already long line formed. Fortunately, group 5 able seated right away. Service quick fast-paced without feeling rushed. I starter shishito peppers blistered nicely went perfectly thin sweet soy sauce served with. My kid got karaage chicken. Flavor slightly different, otherwise typical good chicken karaage.. The side rice ordered slightly wet. I ordered tonkatsu XD. OMG.. broth creamy, salty (in good way), flavorful. So delicious. The egg perfectly soft boiled sweet pork belly Chashu tender flavorful. So frikkin yummy. Served thin ramen noodles. MMm yummy! The decor setup clean. No restroom restaurant, must use public restrooms Japan center.OOH Marufuku, far thin noodle place I've I've ACTUALLY liked. And I felt worth wait. And also, somehow, incredibly, worth $16?! All all, great bowl ramen.First things first: get EARLY. Their waitlist opens EXACTLY 11:30 closes 12:00 FULL. If line one first ~20 people so, whip phone put name waitlist ASAP.Now. Onto ramen itself. I got tonkotsu DX, extra kakuni, nori, corn make well worth it. The broth *extremely* rich, pairs well super melty braised pork refreshing crunchy corn. My brother got chicken paitan girlfriend regular tonkotsu, said wished got DX. Plus, often going wait line ramen? Get deluxe.It also bears mentioning DO veggie ramen request loaded vegetables similarly rich broth. It looked amazing.Small things I like really push 5 stars:1. Despite really crowded, run tight ship gently nudge door. Maybe might like it, people selfish.2. They send everyone away they're full. The waitlist closed one waiting anymore time seated. I'm glad dont leave hanging like Orenchi joints cant serve you. It's nice sign respect.3. Their lime lemon / mint spa water delicious cuts otherwise mega rich broth super well.Overall great bowl ramen willing endure wait. Definitely worth checking out.---Sweet: lives hype! Super rich broth, firm noodles. Fast, efficient service Bitter: wait (of course!)If get early wait less 30 min. They crank goodOverall ramen well average holy grail. The. thick slice pork good I almost liked thin noodles Skip Karaage. But get Marufuku BitesHands best ramen SF. wanting try place long never went long lines. I finally decided go Friday dinner arrived 30 minutes opened there's already line. We lucky get Chicken Paitan dx, around 15 servings day. I still remember pleasant smell chicken came sizzling hot plate. It's juicy savory smoky - can't ask better savory dish. The ramen also amazing soup flavorful.Price fair I would definitely want back another time. Maybe weekday wait shorter.Had Hakata Ramen. There's nothing wrong ramen personally didnt taste anything special good I yesterday I would come East Bay wait line it... thankfully I I happened passing wait line since I early. The ramen alright nothing rave about. Soup savory good thing hot warm that's I still gave 3 star. Ramen personal preference try yourself. But me, something I would return for.They short simple menu four choices ramen. Tried Hakata ramen. Hakata ramen known rich, cloudy milky pork bone broth. I impressed rich savory broth here. The noodles thin Hakata style noodles. Since they're thin, get soft easily. I eat pretty slow, get less firm chewy I neared end.Although ramen delicious, still worth 50 minute wait. I came weekend evening, put name Yelp waitlist, headed out. I actively wait place. If business things getting called in, definitely worth try.Here's thing Marufuku Ramen SF.*I actually dined back unable complete review now.In total - know want - entire dining experience completed ~20 minutes. This negative aspect restaurant. Quite contrary - I put name ~10 minutes opened. Sat 20 minutes later, within 5-10 minutes got food.There's something special place. Not meal brought quickly, also delicious. I'm expert Ramen, fact I find concept recent ramen craze little silly; however, Marufuku Ramen SF hands favorite ramen bay area.HAKATA TONKOTSUIMO, Ramen really comes broth. It's savory, there's touch earthy-game-y-ness really makes dish. The noodles cooked perfectly acutroumonts round dish.Yelp jokes aside, is, "As good gets!"We talkin bout broth? We talkin bout flavor? Easily one best I've USA (my ramen standards based country since Japan's ramen pedestal). I got tonkotsu ramen flavor amazing. You see fat oils pork floating top soup. It salty, rich, right. The pork belly remarkable go ramen broth meat. We waited hour got right opened. It worth wait. The line moved fairly fast service good. An easy 5 star experience. If Japan town want super quality ramen, stop further.The Yelp app best friend want dine here. Get name waitlist ASAP (the app requires within 7 miles list). The wait us Friday night (7pm) 110-140 minutes. We told arrive 8:42pm I gotta say, pretty accurate. It gave us time things instead standing front restaurant, waiting called. It's fairly small place I understand extremely long wait, especially larger parties dining. I'm guessing place fits 30-40 diners time.What ordered:- Takoyaki: I'm huge fan general decent, sauce overpowering.- Geso Fry: fried squid mayo dipping sauce! Or least I think mayo. Not crispy I usually like fried squid.- Chicken Karaage: blow minds fried well- Hakata Tonkotsu (mild, corn): broth rich hot, I feel vital part delicious ramen. The ramen noodle wow me, thinner I'm used (not traditional ramen noodles I'm use to) cooked well.- Hakata Tonkotsu DX (medium): thick cut pork belly makes soup much richer medium spice changes taste compared regular hakata tonkotsu. Equally delicious, bigger kick former.Service great, handed menus water seated attentive wanted water. The food decently priced well ($12.99 Hakata Tonkotsu $16.99 DX). Definitely give try!**Before I dive 3-star review Marufuku, let preface saying I Japanese self-proclaimed ramen snob. Having grown eating lot good ramen Tokyo, I VERY high expectations.** I came 11:10 Tuesday bc Hinodeya street closed I really craving ramen. There already line 15-20 people waiting I arrived! The line moved pretty quickly doors opened I seated promptly after. I hurriedly placed order Chicken Paitan Dx (since there's 15-meal limit per day) slice pork kakuni side bc I feeling particularly gluttonous also wanted taste Tonkotsu Dx. The meal came 5-10 min placing order everything looked great...but greatness really stopped there, unfortunately. The star player Paitan Dx, grilled chicken leg, quite tasty bold distinctive herbal flavors, ramen reeeally nothing special. The thin noodles slightly cooked broth oily bland lacked depth. (I ordered mine medium spicy I could taste chili.) The kakuni cold tough tender fatty/juicy like pork belly kakuni traditional Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. The redeeming factor sad lunch staff welcoming, friendly wonderful! The food definitely 3 stars level service closer 5 stars. All all, however, experience disappointing, especially since I spent 20 min waiting line mediocre bowl "ramen". I understand people queue this... For $26 meal tip, very, subpar. :(This might BEST ramen I United States. Loved chicken paitan (reminds famous place I've tried Tokyo - Kagari Ramen Ginza). The broth rich creamy chicken tender. Hakata tonakatsu good too, chicken paitan way go! Make sure get yelp waitlist soon open - I joined waitlist upon arriving restaurant waited 2 hours. Obviously would prefer shorter wait, even 2 hours, food well worth it.I always wait hour line food, I - Marufuku Ramen.I got hour place opened Saturday already line 10 people deep. The restaurant inside mall thankfully I exposed elements.After hour began seating. I grew increasingly nervous I saw tables inside (very small) restaurant begin fill up. If sat first seating, we'd probably wait 1 2 hours next seating. Thankfully, made last booth there!We end sharing booth another couple, much preferred waiting next seating. Once inside, energy fast paced. No one leisure. The staff interested turning tables quickly possible, patrons slurp noodles leave.We ordered Hakata Tonkotsu DX ramen Chicken Paitan DX, make 15 day. It took five minutes get ramen us, man sight behold. The bowls gorgeous smell delightful.The Tonkotsu ramen deliciously rich broths I've ever had, chicken served Chicken Paitan moist savory, slightly sweet marinade.We half hour, freeing seat next eager patrons quickly could. If fence waiting hour eat here, definitely do. You disappointed.Really yummy food...best ramen we've had! The chicken karaage really good, get karaage buns green salad plum sauce tasty too! Can't go wrong here!Hyped, like Micheline star badges!Even use Yelp Waiting list, still waited 1.5 hours table 5 people.I think friends I agree broth good. Strong flavorful.

He even finish piece chicken.I agree vegetarian ramen one best I've ever comes plain boring vegetarian ramen. It flavorful, broth amazing made wonder cooked broth meat.But hyped justified worth wait?

I ordered Hakata Tonkotsu pork based ramen served chasu, soft boiled egg (it's buried inside ramen, cooked perfectly), wood ear mushrooms, green onions, bean sprouts. Choose spice level, I recommend ultra spicy I eat Carolina Reapers breakfast. Go medium like spice. They use thinner type noodles (similar Ippudo's) cooked al dente. The bowl real deceiving comes portion size. A us ordered refill noodles finish all. Definitely pace come hungry. A bowl already filling enough. We also ordered shishito peppers might filled us up. These pretty huge came soy dipping sauce. They also Calpico popular non-carbonated soft drink. Overall, highly recommended I suggest anticipate 45-60 minute wait order seated.Marufuku one ramen spots I go I get Ramen Nagi cravings, still quite satisfied meal. The Tonkotsu Hakata ramen Chicken Paitans tasty bowls ramen. The ramen hot, broth rich, creamy, flavorful, bit sweet. I love corn add bit sweetness savory rich broth! The noodles unfortunately I find bit thin liking, hakata style noodles. I eat faster otherwise go soft quickly. I got one chicken leg dry like desert. There difference quality one Oakland spot.

She deserved tip praise manager.The men's bathroom closed temporarily cleaning dinner hours, perhaps due "incident."This place pretty good, pricey (as expected restaurant pier). We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.We came boyfriend's family visiting figured would great reviews since touristy area. We surprised good food service was. The portions also big (even sharing plate) everyone liked got. We added spice garlic noodles Lazy cioppino would definitely recommend!Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point!

Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting. For main dishes, I'd recommend Linguine & Clams Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, shrimp). The seafood fresh tasting sauces dishes really tasty. Overall, happy full!2/16/2019My daughter home college birthday weekend. She always wants see bay ocean comes home, make point that.

Soft afternoon light settled white table cloth plates, giving warm yet fancy atmosphere. We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!! There delicious wok smokiness made impossible stop going back more.Again, I divine meal last night would definitely reccommend anyone area come check amazing place out.That scallop risotto though. Best ever. The scallops perfectly cooked melted mouth. The sauce perfectly made went well risotto crab well light pesto sauce. I party 4 2 us ordered risotto 4 us loved get enough it.

Overall, fine dining Asian fusion homey feeling restaurant delivers! I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantBirthday dinner boyfriend. Arrived reservations got seated right away. Off bat. It big restaurant pretty empty first arrived. It gets packed later reservations would must. We shared octopus appetizer goodness. It tender I loved sauce used. I got sea bass came garlic noodles mini green beans. To honest, I high expectations spot bookmarked years. Pretty disappointed- salted definitely make home. He got ahi tuna liked it. I tried well pretty good. We also got dessert- passion fruit coconut creme brûlée. I liked coconut part passion fruit sauce made dessert very, bitter. I ended scraping sauce finishing dessert. :)Overall, nice restaurant I'm glad I finally tried restaurant. Would back octopus appetizer items menu.is favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk. To super safe, paid garage UC College Law couple blocks down.Service always attentive importantly talented staff pleasing eyes! The staff usually wear red lunch black dinner.dont know post photosThis one favorite meals holiday San Francisco. Born raised Hong Kong, I'm usually skeptical Asian fusion cuisine I quite liked creativity surrounding food here. My friends I made reservation restaurant quite small - even reservation, seat whole party present. We decided share following:Deep Fried Salmon Roll: These rolls really crispy outside! I liked salmon cooked medium rare inside still really soft. This quite big portion starter great sharing.Seared Scallops: These really buttery cooked perfectly. The scallops really succulent. I also liked different dressings went this. It's super flavorful overpowering. Probably second favorite dish night.Grilled Seabass, Ginger Garlic Soy: This favorite dish night! The sea bass deliciously moist flaky. I thought sauce bit overpowering luckily served side control much use.Wasabi House Noodles, Flatiron Steak: I skeptical first tasted quite nice. I'm glad wasabi flavor strong steak really nice I'd probably still try something new next time.Seared Ahi Tuna Rice: This yummy also miss much order this. It's quite big portion tuna steaks cooked perfectly. It's cut thick served medium rare. I really liked sauce went too.Pork Chop, Pomegranate Sauce: Usually fan pork chops I've let dry rough ones pork chop really tender flavorful. Loved pomegranate sauce too!For dessert, ordered mango tapioca chocolate cake. Both yummy! The mango tapioca like Cantonese dessert, mango sago, except creamier thicker.Overall, everything delicious well fed group five. The price bit steep negative, worth splurge especially visitor SF!I've dying try The House long time I finally got try lunch!The space small clean attention detail interesting artwork, attentive friendly staff, little house detail paper table setting. Funny detail: mirror bathroom, mirror towards entrance.Here's ordered:Demon Slayer Sake shot - I definitely ordered name. The flavor notes exactly described: fruity, honey notes.

I would definitely eat again, I'm interested rest menu would like try dinner.How I love place. The House best taste ever SF. Book 2 days hopefully greag experience. The portion seems small really satisfying perfect. I called best Asian fusion dish. The menu seasonal I think. Price? I'm saying worth every penny.One favorite places eat North Beach. I stick Seabass I absolutely adore fish done right boy place right. Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)Four us great time House! I able make reservation day two advance, seated right away arrived. We saw menu decided split appetizers:* Dumplings: good, probably one favorites night!* Grilled octopus: hands-down favorite dish - * Tempura soft-shelled crab: delicious served yummy cold noodles* Clams: great!* Barbecue oysters: huge oysters packed flavor!We ordered entrees offered tastes other:* Wasabi noodles steak: perfectly cooked steak delicious noodles* Mushroom rice prawns: grilled prawns AMAZING; I wish create balanced rice-to-prawn ratio!* Sea bass: I definitely order next time I visit* Salmon: I normally like salmon, fan, definitely get dish, I really enjoyed it!So it. The House really small, intimate restaurant, food comes quickly delicious. At point group feel rushed leave!Deep fried salmon roll ---- 10/10Sashimi------------------8/10Octopus -----------------8/10Sea bass-----------------10/10Flat iron steak------------9/10New York steak (special) --8/10The house favorite restaurant San Francisco. For price. I've total 3 times incredible meal time. You cannot go wrong seafood. Just get sea bass happy....highly recommend.Came good bye dinner friends. Tiny little spot hidden away North Beach. Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BSmall popular place directly Chinatown. Judging photos, thought place would super frills surprisingly cozy intimate. We made reservation calling seated lovely host, although wait bit upon arrival (makes sense, small). I would describe cuisine Asian fusion. Our server gem gave many awesome recommendations, shared 4-5 specials night. For 3 people, server suggested sharing: Wasabi Noodles (side) - 5/5 must order noodle fan- great wasabi taste overpoweringFried Salmon Rolls - 3/5 I personally like salmon raw/rare one cooked since deep fried...Manilla Clams - 4.5/5 I loved dish! Very flavorfulPoke app (special) - 3.5/5 regular poke avocado wasabi flairUni App - 5/5 much like eel sushi roll much better. Very unique hit. Overall, I would definitely return everything great here, especially like wasabi flavors seafood things!This place good worth crazy wait. Came I noticed line short 20mins wait time. Sometimes I think people see line think "oh must worth wait!" IMHO wait 45mins hour+ favor find somewhere else eat. The hakata style ramen good hits spot. There's option chicken leg I think that's popular option worth money. I got regular hakata tonkatsu ramen delicious! Came egg, chaushu, usual veg (sprouts scallions).Delicious, slightly overrated, ramen staple Japantown. Make sure get deluxe ramen, miss thick cut pork belly. Seriously, I'd inject bloodstream I could.Also, prepared wait. Unless show restaurant opens, quite ways back waitlist.Meh meh meh...overhyped. Waitlist system awesome. I think Chinese company owns ramen spots Japan. Hinodeya Mugizo well beginning Japanese staff, Filipino Chinese. Maybe training off.Firm hakata skinny noodles quite doughy still. Noodles bland broths much depth oily, thin broth coat noodles I would say. Tonkotsu Paiten tastes same. The spice levels makes difference changes broth. We 3, spicy, medium, spicy. I tried tell pork chicken. No spicy tonkotsu looks like paiten ramen spots specialize paiten. Chashu, kakuni, nothing special all. Chicken breast tender. Worst rice bowls. Japanese noodle places always high end side dons premium koshihikari rice Japan. This pathetic annoying cheap calrose even short grain jasmine looking even exists. And wet, wtf, measured? Mentaiko seasoned mixture natural whole pieces, stupid flavor even tastes like mentaiko. It's expensive mix shit get miles it. Karaage sticky gelatinous texture salty flavors. Bland again. The salad Ramune best. Service lacking. Food came time. With small ass table, imagine frustration. About squeeze lemon karaage fucking ramen shows shut fuck eat ramen right away. Ramen rule last thing come. Wake up. Did I need order karaage salad first order ramen I ready? It obvious. Again, Japanese culture here. Should went Benihana Emperor's Feast Samurai Treat, mistakes teppanyaki. Or Steve Aoki's dad Rocky's Choice. SF Bay Area - favorites Santouka Ippudo consistent accurate time. Halu best noodles, go ramen waste time. It's yakitori, order bunch "skewers" still hungry ramen.Came weekday afternoon. It 15 minutes opening dinner (5:30pm) already long line formed. Fortunately, group 5 able seated right away. Service quick fast-paced without feeling rushed. I starter shishito peppers blistered nicely went perfectly thin sweet soy sauce served with. My kid got karaage chicken. Flavor slightly different, otherwise typical good chicken karaage.. The side rice ordered slightly wet. I ordered tonkatsu XD. OMG.. broth creamy, salty (in good way), flavorful. So delicious. The egg perfectly soft boiled sweet pork belly Chashu tender flavorful. So frikkin yummy. Served thin ramen noodles. MMm yummy! The decor setup clean. No restroom restaurant, must use public restrooms Japan center.OOH Marufuku, far thin noodle place I've I've ACTUALLY liked. And I felt worth wait. And also, somehow, incredibly, worth $16?! All all, great bowl ramen.First things first: get EARLY. Their waitlist opens EXACTLY 11:30 closes 12:00 FULL. If line one first ~20 people so, whip phone put name waitlist ASAP.Now. Onto ramen itself. I got tonkotsu DX, extra kakuni, nori, corn make well worth it. The broth *extremely* rich, pairs well super melty braised pork refreshing crunchy corn. My brother got chicken paitan girlfriend regular tonkotsu, said wished got DX. Plus, often going wait line ramen? Get deluxe.It also bears mentioning DO veggie ramen request loaded vegetables similarly rich broth. It looked amazing.Small things I like really push 5 stars:1. Despite really crowded, run tight ship gently nudge door. Maybe might like it, people selfish.2. They send everyone away they're full. The waitlist closed one waiting anymore time seated. I'm glad dont leave hanging like Orenchi joints cant serve you. It's nice sign respect.3. Their lime lemon / mint spa water delicious cuts otherwise mega rich broth super well.Overall great bowl ramen willing endure wait. Definitely worth checking out.---Sweet: lives hype! Super rich broth, firm noodles. Fast, efficient service Bitter: wait (of course!)If get early wait less 30 min. They crank goodOverall ramen well average holy grail. The. thick slice pork good I almost liked thin noodles Skip Karaage. But get Marufuku BitesHad Hakata Ramen. There's nothing wrong ramen personally didnt taste anything special good I yesterday I would come East Bay wait line it... thankfully I I happened passing wait line since I early. The ramen alright nothing rave about. Soup savory good thing hot warm that's I still gave 3 star. Ramen personal preference try yourself. But me, something I would return for.Hands best ramen SF. wanting try place long never went long lines. I finally decided go Friday dinner arrived 30 minutes opened there's already line. We lucky get Chicken Paitan dx, around 15 servings day. I still remember pleasant smell chicken came sizzling hot plate. It's juicy savory smoky - can't ask better savory dish. The ramen also amazing soup flavorful.Price fair I would definitely want back another time. Maybe weekday wait shorter.They short simple menu four choices ramen. Tried Hakata ramen. Hakata ramen known rich, cloudy milky pork bone broth. I impressed rich savory broth here. The noodles thin Hakata style noodles. Since they're thin, get soft easily. I eat pretty slow, get less firm chewy I neared end.Although ramen delicious, still worth 50 minute wait. I came weekend evening, put name Yelp waitlist, headed out. I actively wait place. If business things getting called in, definitely worth try.Here's thing Marufuku Ramen SF.*I actually dined back unable complete review now.In total - know want - entire dining experience completed ~20 minutes. This negative aspect restaurant. Quite contrary - I put name ~10 minutes opened. Sat 20 minutes later, within 5-10 minutes got food.There's something special place. Not meal brought quickly, also delicious. I'm expert Ramen, fact I find concept recent ramen craze little silly; however, Marufuku Ramen SF hands favorite ramen bay area.HAKATA TONKOTSUIMO, Ramen really comes broth. It's savory, there's touch earthy-game-y-ness really makes dish. The noodles cooked perfectly acutroumonts round dish.Yelp jokes aside, is, "As good gets!"**Before I dive 3-star review Marufuku, let preface saying I Japanese self-proclaimed ramen snob. Having grown eating lot good ramen Tokyo, I VERY high expectations.** I came 11:10 Tuesday bc Hinodeya street closed I really craving ramen. There already line 15-20 people waiting I arrived! The line moved pretty quickly doors opened I seated promptly after. I hurriedly placed order Chicken Paitan Dx (since there's 15-meal limit per day) slice pork kakuni side bc I feeling particularly gluttonous also wanted taste Tonkotsu Dx. The meal came 5-10 min placing order everything looked great...but greatness really stopped there, unfortunately. The star player Paitan Dx, grilled chicken leg, quite tasty bold distinctive herbal flavors, ramen reeeally nothing special. The thin noodles slightly cooked broth oily bland lacked depth. (I ordered mine medium spicy I could taste chili.) The kakuni cold tough tender fatty/juicy like pork belly kakuni traditional Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. The redeeming factor sad lunch staff welcoming, friendly wonderful! The food definitely 3 stars level service closer 5 stars. All all, however, experience disappointing, especially since I spent 20 min waiting line mediocre bowl "ramen". I understand people queue this... For $26 meal tip, very, subpar. :(We talkin bout broth? We talkin bout flavor? Easily one best I've USA (my ramen standards based country since Japan's ramen pedestal). I got tonkotsu ramen flavor amazing. You see fat oils pork floating top soup. It salty, rich, right. The pork belly remarkable go ramen broth meat. We waited hour got right opened. It worth wait. The line moved fairly fast service good. An easy 5 star experience. If Japan town want super quality ramen, stop further.I always wait hour line food, I - Marufuku Ramen.I got hour place opened Saturday already line 10 people deep. The restaurant inside mall thankfully I exposed elements.After hour began seating. I grew increasingly nervous I saw tables inside (very small) restaurant begin fill up. If sat first seating, we'd probably wait 1 2 hours next seating. Thankfully, made last booth there!We end sharing booth another couple, much preferred waiting next seating. Once inside, energy fast paced. No one leisure. The staff interested turning tables quickly possible, patrons slurp noodles leave.We ordered Hakata Tonkotsu DX ramen Chicken Paitan DX, make 15 day. It took five minutes get ramen us, man sight behold. The bowls gorgeous smell delightful.The Tonkotsu ramen deliciously rich broths I've ever had, chicken served Chicken Paitan moist savory, slightly sweet marinade.We half hour, freeing seat next eager patrons quickly could. If fence waiting hour eat here, definitely do. You disappointed.The Yelp app best friend want dine here. Get name waitlist ASAP (the app requires within 7 miles list). The wait us Friday night (7pm) 110-140 minutes. We told arrive 8:42pm I gotta say, pretty accurate. It gave us time things instead standing front restaurant, waiting called. It's fairly small place I understand extremely long wait, especially larger parties dining. I'm guessing place fits 30-40 diners time.What ordered:- Takoyaki: I'm huge fan general decent, sauce overpowering.- Geso Fry: fried squid mayo dipping sauce! Or least I think mayo. Not crispy I usually like fried squid.- Chicken Karaage: blow minds fried well- Hakata Tonkotsu (mild, corn): broth rich hot, I feel vital part delicious ramen. The ramen noodle wow me, thinner I'm used (not traditional ramen noodles I'm use to) cooked well.- Hakata Tonkotsu DX (medium): thick cut pork belly makes soup much richer medium spice changes taste compared regular hakata tonkotsu. Equally delicious, bigger kick former.Service great, handed menus water seated attentive wanted water. The food decently priced well ($12.99 Hakata Tonkotsu $16.99 DX). Definitely give try!This might BEST ramen I United States. Loved chicken paitan (reminds famous place I've tried Tokyo - Kagari Ramen Ginza). The broth rich creamy chicken tender. Hakata tonakatsu good too, chicken paitan way go! Make sure get yelp waitlist soon open - I joined waitlist upon arriving restaurant waited 2 hours. Obviously would prefer shorter wait, even 2 hours, food well worth it.My boyfriend I came lunch arrived half hour closed line still pretty long. Luckily, still able accomodate us made us wait little bit. Restaurant clean bright tiny. The tables close I walking seat, butt literally neighbor's table. Oops. We could also hear conversations not. They also communal seating bigger tables.Service fast food good! decided go Hakata Tonkotsu DX bf ordered Chicken Paitan DX.

Luckily utilized wait list feature put queue headed over. I got notification table ready recommended arrival time quoted. That fine half party within block away 5 minutes check host. When arrived, promptly notified host rest group coming. The restaurant accommodating held us everyone arrived. I ordered Hakata Tonkotsu pork based ramen served chasu, soft boiled egg (it's buried inside ramen, cooked perfectly), wood ear mushrooms, green onions, bean sprouts. Choose spice level, I recommend ultra spicy I eat Carolina Reapers breakfast. Go medium like spice. They use thinner type noodles (similar Ippudo's) cooked al dente. The bowl real deceiving comes portion size. A us ordered refill noodles finish all. Definitely pace come hungry. A bowl already filling enough. We also ordered shishito peppers might filled us up. These pretty huge came soy dipping sauce. They also Calpico popular non-carbonated soft drink. Overall, highly recommended I suggest anticipate 45-60 minute wait order seated.Marufuku one ramen spots I go I get Ramen Nagi cravings, still quite satisfied meal. The Tonkotsu Hakata ramen Chicken Paitans tasty bowls ramen. The ramen hot, broth rich, creamy, flavorful, bit sweet. I love corn add bit sweetness savory rich broth! The noodles unfortunately I find bit thin liking, hakata style noodles. I eat faster otherwise go soft quickly. I got one chicken leg dry like desert. There difference quality one Oakland spot. The wait insane, I like yelp online waitlist. Save us time productive something else! The ramen good I say "Best bowl ramen I've ever had", wow factor. Ramen Nagi still wins heart.

We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.We came boyfriend's family visiting figured would great reviews since touristy area. We surprised good food service was. The portions also big (even sharing plate) everyone liked got. We added spice garlic noodles Lazy cioppino would definitely recommend!Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point!

They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting. For main dishes, I'd recommend Linguine & Clams Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, shrimp). The seafood fresh tasting sauces dishes really tasty.

Soft afternoon light settled white table cloth plates, giving warm yet fancy atmosphere. We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!!

Overall, fine dining Asian fusion homey feeling restaurant delivers! I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantBirthday dinner boyfriend. Arrived reservations got seated right away. Off bat. It big restaurant pretty empty first arrived. It gets packed later reservations would must. We shared octopus appetizer goodness. It tender I loved sauce used. I got sea bass came garlic noodles mini green beans. To honest, I high expectations spot bookmarked years. Pretty disappointed- salted definitely make home. He got ahi tuna liked it. I tried well pretty good. We also got dessert- passion fruit coconut creme brûlée. I liked coconut part passion fruit sauce made dessert very, bitter. I ended scraping sauce finishing dessert. :)Overall, nice restaurant I'm glad I finally tried restaurant. Would back octopus appetizer items menu.is favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk. To super safe, paid garage UC College Law couple blocks down.Service always attentive importantly talented staff pleasing eyes! The staff usually wear red lunch black dinner.dont know post photosThis one favorite meals holiday San Francisco. Born raised Hong Kong, I'm usually skeptical Asian fusion cuisine I quite liked creativity surrounding food here. My friends I made reservation restaurant quite small - even reservation, seat whole party present. We decided share following:Deep Fried Salmon Roll: These rolls really crispy outside! I liked salmon cooked medium rare inside still really soft. This quite big portion starter great sharing.Seared Scallops: These really buttery cooked perfectly. The scallops really succulent. I also liked different dressings went this. It's super flavorful overpowering. Probably second favorite dish night.Grilled Seabass, Ginger Garlic Soy: This favorite dish night!

I'm glad wasabi flavor strong steak really nice I'd probably still try something new next time.Seared Ahi Tuna Rice: This yummy also miss much order this. It's quite big portion tuna steaks cooked perfectly. It's cut thick served medium rare. I really liked sauce went too.Pork Chop, Pomegranate Sauce: Usually fan pork chops I've let dry rough ones pork chop really tender flavorful. Loved pomegranate sauce too!For dessert, ordered mango tapioca chocolate cake. Both yummy! The mango tapioca like Cantonese dessert, mango sago, except creamier thicker.Overall, everything delicious well fed group five. The price bit steep negative, worth splurge especially visitor SF!I've dying try The House long time I finally got try lunch!The space small clean attention detail interesting artwork, attentive friendly staff, little house detail paper table setting. Funny detail: mirror bathroom, mirror towards entrance.Here's ordered:Demon Slayer Sake shot - I definitely ordered name. The flavor notes exactly described: fruity, honey notes.

I would definitely eat again, I'm interested rest menu would like try dinner.How I love place. The House best taste ever SF. Book 2 days hopefully greag experience. The portion seems small really satisfying perfect. I called best Asian fusion dish. The menu seasonal I think. Price? I'm saying worth every penny.One favorite places eat North Beach. I stick Seabass I absolutely adore fish done right boy place right. Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)Four us great time House! I able make reservation day two advance, seated right away arrived. We saw menu decided split appetizers:* Dumplings: good, probably one favorites night!* Grilled octopus: hands-down favorite dish - * Tempura soft-shelled crab: delicious served yummy cold noodles* Clams: great!* Barbecue oysters: huge oysters packed flavor!We ordered entrees offered tastes other:* Wasabi noodles steak: perfectly cooked steak delicious noodles* Mushroom rice prawns: grilled prawns AMAZING; I wish create balanced rice-to-prawn ratio!* Sea bass: I definitely order next time I visit* Salmon: I normally like salmon, fan, definitely get dish, I really enjoyed it!So it. The House really small, intimate restaurant, food comes quickly delicious. At point group feel rushed leave!Deep fried salmon roll ---- 10/10Sashimi------------------8/10Octopus -----------------8/10Sea bass-----------------10/10Flat iron steak------------9/10New York steak (special) --8/10The house favorite restaurant San Francisco. For price. I've total 3 times incredible meal time. You cannot go wrong seafood. Just get sea bass happy....highly recommend.Came good bye dinner friends. Tiny little spot hidden away North Beach. Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BSmall popular place directly Chinatown. Judging photos, thought place would super frills surprisingly cozy intimate. We made reservation calling seated lovely host, although wait bit upon arrival (makes sense, small). I would describe cuisine Asian fusion. Our server gem gave many awesome recommendations, shared 4-5 specials night. For 3 people, server suggested sharing: Wasabi Noodles (side) - 5/5 must order noodle fan- great wasabi taste overpoweringFried Salmon Rolls - 3/5 I personally like salmon raw/rare one cooked since deep fried...Manilla Clams - 4.5/5 I loved dish! Very flavorfulPoke app (special) - 3.5/5 regular poke avocado wasabi flairUni App - 5/5 much like eel sushi roll much better. Very unique hit. Overall, I would definitely return everything great here, especially like wasabi flavors seafood things!This place good worth crazy wait. Came I noticed line short 20mins wait time. Sometimes I think people see line think "oh must worth wait!" IMHO wait 45mins hour+ favor find somewhere else eat. The hakata style ramen good hits spot. There's option chicken leg I think that's popular option worth money. I got regular hakata tonkatsu ramen delicious! Came egg, chaushu, usual veg (sprouts scallions).Delicious, slightly overrated, ramen staple Japantown. Make sure get deluxe ramen, miss thick cut pork belly. Seriously, I'd inject bloodstream I could.Also, prepared wait. Unless show restaurant opens, quite ways back waitlist.Meh meh meh...overhyped. Waitlist system awesome. I think Chinese company owns ramen spots Japan. Hinodeya Mugizo well beginning Japanese staff, Filipino Chinese. Maybe training off.Firm hakata skinny noodles quite doughy still. Noodles bland broths much depth oily, thin broth coat noodles I would say. Tonkotsu Paiten tastes same. The spice levels makes difference changes broth. We 3, spicy, medium, spicy. I tried tell pork chicken. No spicy tonkotsu looks like paiten ramen spots specialize paiten. Chashu, kakuni, nothing special all. Chicken breast tender. Worst rice bowls. Japanese noodle places always high end side dons premium koshihikari rice Japan. This pathetic annoying cheap calrose even short grain jasmine looking even exists. And wet, wtf, measured? Mentaiko seasoned mixture natural whole pieces, stupid flavor even tastes like mentaiko. It's expensive mix shit get miles it. Karaage sticky gelatinous texture salty flavors. Bland again. The salad Ramune best. Service lacking. Food came time. With small ass table, imagine frustration. About squeeze lemon karaage fucking ramen shows shut fuck eat ramen right away. Ramen rule last thing come. Wake up. Did I need order karaage salad first order ramen I ready? It obvious. Again, Japanese culture here. Should went Benihana Emperor's Feast Samurai Treat, mistakes teppanyaki. Or Steve Aoki's dad Rocky's Choice. SF Bay Area - favorites Santouka Ippudo consistent accurate time. Halu best noodles, go ramen waste time. It's yakitori, order bunch "skewers" still hungry ramen.Came weekday afternoon. It 15 minutes opening dinner (5:30pm) already long line formed. Fortunately, group 5 able seated right away. Service quick fast-paced without feeling rushed. I starter shishito peppers blistered nicely went perfectly thin sweet soy sauce served with. My kid got karaage chicken. Flavor slightly different, otherwise typical good chicken karaage.. The side rice ordered slightly wet. I ordered tonkatsu XD. OMG.. broth creamy, salty (in good way), flavorful. So delicious. The egg perfectly soft boiled sweet pork belly Chashu tender flavorful. So frikkin yummy. Served thin ramen noodles. MMm yummy! The decor setup clean. No restroom restaurant, must use public restrooms Japan center.OOH Marufuku, far thin noodle place I've I've ACTUALLY liked. And I felt worth wait. And also, somehow, incredibly, worth $16?! All all, great bowl ramen.First things first: get EARLY. Their waitlist opens EXACTLY 11:30 closes 12:00 FULL. If line one first ~20 people so, whip phone put name waitlist ASAP.Now. Onto ramen itself. I got tonkotsu DX, extra kakuni, nori, corn make well worth it. The broth *extremely* rich, pairs well super melty braised pork refreshing crunchy corn. My brother got chicken paitan girlfriend regular tonkotsu, said wished got DX. Plus, often going wait line ramen? Get deluxe.It also bears mentioning DO veggie ramen request loaded vegetables similarly rich broth. It looked amazing.Small things I like really push 5 stars:1. Despite really crowded, run tight ship gently nudge door. Maybe might like it, people selfish.2. They send everyone away they're full. The waitlist closed one waiting anymore time seated. I'm glad dont leave hanging like Orenchi joints cant serve you. It's nice sign respect.3. Their lime lemon / mint spa water delicious cuts otherwise mega rich broth super well.Overall great bowl ramen willing endure wait. Definitely worth checking out.---Sweet: lives hype! Super rich broth, firm noodles. Fast, efficient service Bitter: wait (of course!)If get early wait less 30 min. They crank goodOverall ramen well average holy grail. The. thick slice pork good I almost liked thin noodles Skip Karaage. But get Marufuku BitesHad Hakata Ramen. There's nothing wrong ramen personally didnt taste anything special good I yesterday I would come East Bay wait line it... thankfully I I happened passing wait line since I early. The ramen alright nothing rave about. Soup savory good thing hot warm that's I still gave 3 star. Ramen personal preference try yourself. But me, something I would return for.Hands best ramen SF. wanting try place long never went long lines. I finally decided go Friday dinner arrived 30 minutes opened there's already line. We lucky get Chicken Paitan dx, around 15 servings day. I still remember pleasant smell chicken came sizzling hot plate. It's juicy savory smoky - can't ask better savory dish. The ramen also amazing soup flavorful.Price fair I would definitely want back another time. Maybe weekday wait shorter.They short simple menu four choices ramen. Tried Hakata ramen. Hakata ramen known rich, cloudy milky pork bone broth. I impressed rich savory broth here. The noodles thin Hakata style noodles. Since they're thin, get soft easily. I eat pretty slow, get less firm chewy I neared end.Although ramen delicious, still worth 50 minute wait. I came weekend evening, put name Yelp waitlist, headed out. I actively wait place. If business things getting called in, definitely worth try.Here's thing Marufuku Ramen SF.*I actually dined back unable complete review now.In total - know want - entire dining experience completed ~20 minutes. This negative aspect restaurant. Quite contrary - I put name ~10 minutes opened. Sat 20 minutes later, within 5-10 minutes got food.There's something special place. Not meal brought quickly, also delicious. I'm expert Ramen, fact I find concept recent ramen craze little silly; however, Marufuku Ramen SF hands favorite ramen bay area.HAKATA TONKOTSUIMO, Ramen really comes broth. It's savory, there's touch earthy-game-y-ness really makes dish. The noodles cooked perfectly acutroumonts round dish.Yelp jokes aside, is, "As good gets!"**Before I dive 3-star review Marufuku, let preface saying I Japanese self-proclaimed ramen snob. Having grown eating lot good ramen Tokyo, I VERY high expectations.** I came 11:10 Tuesday bc Hinodeya street closed I really craving ramen. There already line 15-20 people waiting I arrived! The line moved pretty quickly doors opened I seated promptly after. I hurriedly placed order Chicken Paitan Dx (since there's 15-meal limit per day) slice pork kakuni side bc I feeling particularly gluttonous also wanted taste Tonkotsu Dx. The meal came 5-10 min placing order everything looked great...but greatness really stopped there, unfortunately. The star player Paitan Dx, grilled chicken leg, quite tasty bold distinctive herbal flavors, ramen reeeally nothing special. The thin noodles slightly cooked broth oily bland lacked depth. (I ordered mine medium spicy I could taste chili.) The kakuni cold tough tender fatty/juicy like pork belly kakuni traditional Hakata Tonkotsu ramen. The redeeming factor sad lunch staff welcoming, friendly wonderful! The food definitely 3 stars level service closer 5 stars. All all, however, experience disappointing, especially since I spent 20 min waiting line mediocre bowl "ramen". I understand people queue this... For $26 meal tip, very, subpar. :(We talkin bout broth? We talkin bout flavor? Easily one best I've USA (my ramen standards based country since Japan's ramen pedestal). I got tonkotsu ramen flavor amazing. You see fat oils pork floating top soup. It salty, rich, right. The pork belly remarkable go ramen broth meat. We waited hour got right opened. It worth wait. The line moved fairly fast service good. An easy 5 star experience. If Japan town want super quality ramen, stop further.I always wait hour line food, I - Marufuku Ramen.I got hour place opened Saturday already line 10 people deep. The restaurant inside mall thankfully I exposed elements.After hour began seating. I grew increasingly nervous I saw tables inside (very small) restaurant begin fill up. If sat first seating, we'd probably wait 1 2 hours next seating. Thankfully, made last booth there!We end sharing booth another couple, much preferred waiting next seating. Once inside, energy fast paced. No one leisure. The staff interested turning tables quickly possible, patrons slurp noodles leave.We ordered Hakata Tonkotsu DX ramen Chicken Paitan DX, make 15 day. It took five minutes get ramen us, man sight behold. The bowls gorgeous smell delightful.The Tonkotsu ramen deliciously rich broths I've ever had, chicken served Chicken Paitan moist savory, slightly sweet marinade.We half hour, freeing seat next eager patrons quickly could. If fence waiting hour eat here, definitely do. You disappointed.The Yelp app best friend want dine here. Get name waitlist ASAP (the app requires within 7 miles list). The wait us Friday night (7pm) 110-140 minutes. We told arrive 8:42pm I gotta say, pretty accurate. It gave us time things instead standing front restaurant, waiting called. It's fairly small place I understand extremely long wait, especially larger parties dining. I'm guessing place fits 30-40 diners time.What ordered:- Takoyaki: I'm huge fan general decent, sauce overpowering.- Geso Fry: fried squid mayo dipping sauce! Or least I think mayo. Not crispy I usually like fried squid.- Chicken Karaage: blow minds fried well- Hakata Tonkotsu (mild, corn): broth rich hot, I feel vital part delicious ramen. The ramen noodle wow me, thinner I'm used (not traditional ramen noodles I'm use to) cooked well.- Hakata Tonkotsu DX (medium): thick cut pork belly makes soup much richer medium spice changes taste compared regular hakata tonkotsu. Equally delicious, bigger kick former.Service great, handed menus water seated attentive wanted water. The food decently priced well ($12.99 Hakata Tonkotsu $16.99 DX). Definitely give try!This might BEST ramen I United States. Loved chicken paitan (reminds famous place I've tried Tokyo - Kagari Ramen Ginza). The broth rich creamy chicken tender. Hakata tonakatsu good too, chicken paitan way go! Make sure get yelp waitlist soon open - I joined waitlist upon arriving restaurant waited 2 hours. Obviously would prefer shorter wait, even 2 hours, food well worth it.My boyfriend I came lunch arrived half hour closed line still pretty long. Luckily, still able accomodate us made us wait little bit. Restaurant clean bright tiny. The tables close I walking seat, butt literally neighbor's table. Oops. We could also hear conversations not. They also communal seating bigger tables.Service fast food good! decided go Hakata Tonkotsu DX bf ordered Chicken Paitan DX. Both tasty especially extras order -- braised thick pork belly grilled chicken leg boyfriend. Also, broth creamy full flavor. It filling ramen craving satisfied! We'll back area crave ramen again. Whichever comes first.Hyped, like Micheline star badges!Even use Yelp Waiting list, still waited 1.5 hours table 5 people.I think friends I agree broth good. Strong flavorful.

The chicken karaage really good, get karaage buns green salad plum sauce tasty too! Can't go wrong here!In order eat need ton patience perfect timing. The reviews pretty much speak comes quality ramen. I high expectations.We latter group 8 wanted Marufuku lunch. Can picture wait times? It could get real ugly! Luckily utilized wait list feature put queue headed over. I got notification table ready recommended arrival time quoted. That fine half party within block away 5 minutes check host. When arrived, promptly notified host rest group coming. The restaurant accommodating held us everyone arrived. I ordered Hakata Tonkotsu pork based ramen served chasu, soft boiled egg (it's buried inside ramen, cooked perfectly), wood ear mushrooms, green onions, bean sprouts. Choose spice level, I recommend ultra spicy I eat Carolina Reapers breakfast. Go medium like spice. They use thinner type noodles (similar Ippudo's) cooked al dente. The bowl real deceiving comes portion size. A us ordered refill noodles finish all. Definitely pace come hungry. A bowl already filling enough. We also ordered shishito peppers might filled us up. These pretty huge came soy dipping sauce. They also Calpico popular non-carbonated soft drink. Overall, highly recommended I suggest anticipate 45-60 minute wait order seated.Marufuku one ramen spots I go I get Ramen Nagi cravings, still quite satisfied meal. The Tonkotsu Hakata ramen Chicken Paitans tasty bowls ramen. The ramen hot, broth rich, creamy, flavorful, bit sweet. I love corn add bit sweetness savory rich broth! The noodles unfortunately I find bit thin liking, hakata style noodles. I eat faster otherwise go soft quickly. I got one chicken leg dry like desert. There difference quality one Oakland spot. The wait insane, I like yelp online waitlist. Save us time productive something else! The ramen good I say "Best bowl ramen I've ever had", wow factor. Ramen Nagi still wins heart.
