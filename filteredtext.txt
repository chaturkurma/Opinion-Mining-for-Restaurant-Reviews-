The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk.

Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)The delicious meal San Francisco.

The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone!

However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever.

Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point! Fog Harbor one best experiences visiting San Francisco. We made reservation one week prime dinner times available, still got good time waited little sit window (so pretty)!This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge. Our waitress tried make neglecting us initially throwing couple extra sourdough rolls go..it helped. Good place overall, patience wait fight crowds tourists.This place delicious cioppino clam chowder. Cioppino seafood stew originated San Francisco first time trying I loved it. Their cioppino red sauce plenty seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce strong tomato garlic taste little bit spicy, overall taste harmonious.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting.

Soft afternoon light settled white table cloth plates, giving warm yet fancy atmosphere. We ordered Clam Chowder Bowl Crab, Shellfish Platter Lobster Tail (for one person), Mixed Grill four us.The Clam Chowder came first plate baguette rolls butter. The place claimed chowder award-wining one. Naturally, I skeptical almost stopped mum ordering, but, boy, I wrong. Unlike chowders I've had, chowder perfectly balance. It creamy, buttery, right amount salt. Not mention, generous amount crab clam chunks it! I really loved dipping baguette chowder; baguette also delicious. It crispy outside warm pillowy inside. Just bread butter take places.Next Shellfish Platter. It certainly show-stopping dish. It came pile boiled grilled clams, mussels, shrimps, dungess crabs, extra lobster tail. Everything heftily drowsed garlic, butter, oil - could go wrong. Every seafood dish fresh perfectly cooked. I know it, did! The fingerling potatos roasted well soso flavorful. The Mixed Grill consisted grilled shrimps, salmon filet, cod filet, side stir-fried string beans garlic mash potato. The seafood good; favorite salmon, distinct salinity I really enjoyed. But really got string beans!!

We waited awhile order informed server ready. Long wait, horrible service food. We got crab cocktail calamari starter. I highly recommend crab cocktail. It shredded crab delicious. Calamari ok. So I got two lobster tails $58. I thought two perfect favorite, however extremely!!!! Salty, taste good all. I told sever also informed I wanna wait another 20 minutes food.

They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever.

Reservations encouraged sneak days lunch. The service good ton great dishes try. The seabass comes garlic noodles green beans compliment well. If like reviews, consider "following" profile reviews across SF Bay Area. Why "follow" someone? It causes person follow's reviews tier top pull business. I find handy researching venues. Rod's Review grading scale explained. Essentially I personally base likelihood return visit I try stingy 5 star reviews since "special" eyes. Price/Value also play role. Just steak $75 make 4 5 star venue $1 taco unless delicious. 5 stars - "I'll go way" (approx 6 % reviews) 4 stars- "If I area I'd go would recommend", (approx 38% reviews) 3 stars "Maybe nearby", (approx 37% reviews) 2 stars -"Would likely return, Only want go", (approx 16% reviews) 1 star -"No thanks, even I hungry", (approx. 3 % reviews)The delicious meal San Francisco.

Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BCelebrating friend's birthday. Actually first time here, came around 6pm, wait. We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine. There bit wait even reservation. Decent sake wine selection. Went lunch Friday celebrate graduation. I really surprised see busy noon !! Definitely recommend reservations. Food delicious! We calamari, variety salmon dishes, lobster roll, sort bleu cheese appetizer. Drinks great well.Visiting Chicago. Relied Yelp recommendations find Fog Harbor Fish House.

We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point!

Overall, fine dining Asian fusion homey feeling restaurant delivers! I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant.

We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine. There bit wait even reservation. Decent sake wine selection. Went lunch Friday celebrate graduation. I really surprised see busy noon !! Definitely recommend reservations. Food delicious! We calamari, variety salmon dishes, lobster roll, sort bleu cheese appetizer. Drinks great well.Visiting Chicago. Relied Yelp recommendations find Fog Harbor Fish House.

Sourdough bread warm soft.Clam chowder clammy generous portions clam meat.Lazy cippino fresh seafood (deshelled crabmeat, mussels, clams, shrimps) scrumptous broth toasted garlic bread soak juices.Apple crisp crispy top warm gooey apple slices bottom, topped vanilla ice cream.All all, ashamed tourists tourist spot best seafood best view offer.Extra shoutout server Jane. She welcoming, kind, positive attitude. She took care table took pictures us smile. Felt bad got stiffed dingy tip neighbor table appeared foreign visitors.

My husband garlic roasted crab I cioppino. Both good. Can't go wrong here. Ended coffee frangelica whip cream. Yum!!!We back next visit!This place pretty good, pricey (as expected restaurant pier). We ordered things - oysters, mussels fries, scallops risotto. The oysters fresh delicious. The mussels nice tasty, broth tasted delicious fries. The risotto left something desired. They gave 4 scallops, I feel though least come 6. I felt like could've given bit expensive dish. The risotto okay, nothing special. Overall, service great food okay.They gave us amazing table! Right window! Came seafood! Got soup bowl gave us extra also got seafood tower (cold) share. They also give free bread. Loved food. Did explore pier/other biz nearby, certainly make afternoon place sure, whole day. There aquarium couple doors see seals basking int sun. The place huge busy. We RSVP. Service friendly nice. They also would accommodate huge groups 8-10 etc.Located Pier 39, busy restaurant mostly attracts tourists. Reservations recommended especially weekends. However, bar almost always open open seating. Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing. Half dozen oysters fresh cleaned nicely, raised score bit, fried rock shrimp 'special' asparagus ok. I would recommend drinks accompany view. Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!! It bacon good amount clams (don't hate restaurants serve CLAM chowder like two pieces there?) creamy sooooo good sourdough bread bowl. It's good share two people.We also got baked oysters, let tell you, I prefer raw oysters baked, mmmmmmmm served bed rock salt flavor seasoning point! Fog Harbor one best experiences visiting San Francisco. We made reservation one week prime dinner times available, still got good time waited little sit window (so pretty)!This place started 3 stars based first impression- super busy touristy restaurant took us least 10 minutes someone notice us seated, even get drink orders. I truly hesitant quality food realizing located heart Fisherman's wharf. But pleasant surprise, pricy food slightly exceeded expectations. My foodie partner crime, Natalie M., I shared famed clam chowder bowl scallops Dungeness crab risotto, I would highly recommend. The sourdough bread great too, refill charge. Our waitress tried make neglecting us initially throwing couple extra sourdough rolls go..it helped. Good place overall, patience wait fight crowds tourists.This place delicious cioppino clam chowder. Cioppino seafood stew originated San Francisco first time trying I loved it. Their cioppino red sauce plenty seafood including mussels, fish, clams, shellfish, crab, shrimps. The red sauce strong tomato garlic taste little bit spicy, overall taste harmonious. The award winning clam chowder creamy bread bowl sour dough bread tasted better piece garlic beard came cioppino. On top delicious seafood, service great. Our server nice friendly. One tip avoid wait join Yelp waitlist. We arrived couple minutes designated check time table ready promptly.Very busy location, asked party members present order seated. We bigger group 6 people.

Also turn sourdough rolls -- they're perfectly crunchy outside warm fluffy inside. The baked oysters really small, something I'd recommend getting. For main dishes, I'd recommend Linguine & Clams Fresh Mix (cod, salmon, shrimp). The seafood fresh tasting sauces dishes really tasty. Overall, happy full!At really good location, enjoy view pier eating. Bread chowder good!

Almost tables amazing view bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate. I would give restaurant five stars. The menu abundance fresh seafood options, rotating 'seasonal' menu, pastas along 'Award winning clam chowder.' The food 3.5. The sourdough rolls served prior meal stale difficult eat. A table adjacent us actually sent back. The clam appetizer 'steamed chorizo corn' interesting amazing.

Maybe something raw seafood section seem spot on.Oh goodness...when place says serve "Award-Winning Clam Chowder"...they mean it!!!

I would come again!A block around Italian district North Beach comes way casual exclusive, must do, little Asian Fusion restaurant. A reservation must. One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant. As restaurant located heart Tenderloin, street parking available couple blocks Van Ness Polk. To super safe, paid garage UC College Law couple blocks down.Service always attentive importantly talented staff pleasing eyes! The staff usually wear red lunch black dinner.dont know post photosBirthday dinner boyfriend. Arrived reservations got seated right away. Off bat. It big restaurant pretty empty first arrived.

One last days contractor nearby company, I set use expense allowance dinner, lot it.Once inside, feel 2 room little house (hence, same). Dimly lit, perfect setting romance, alike, small dinner function (max 6), friendly get-together.The service outstanding. Each table one main server, help serve cater demands customers.The menu small, mighty:========================1. Shrimp Dumpling [$13, 4.0 stars] -- 6 steamed shrimp. Nothing fancy, nothing write home about.2. Softshell crab [$18, 4.0 stars] -- presentation wonderful, execution -- standard fare. I actually loved cold soba salad (with sesame oil...mmmm) accompanied crab, $18, pass next time.3. Black Miso Cod [$32, 4.5 stars] -- lightly seared, nearly raw, one best I've ever (inside top 5). Served lovely "California" crab/avocado roll, sliced length-wise, makes conversation piece.4. Nigori [$14, 4.0 stars] -- served chilled decanter, little pricey last long. Needed 2.5. Chocolate bread pudding [$9, 5.0 stars] -- decadent chocolatey, served berries fresh whipped cream.Conclusion:=========I love food, indeed, liked it. But whole experience I love. I would go back.This restaurant located north beach tiny reservations definitely recommended! Their menu heavily consists Asian fusion cuisine heavily focused seafood. This second time times food good. The service good room improvement. For appetizers scallops deliciously. Seared nicely generous amounts butter sauce came lick plate good. The fried salmon roll tuna tartar good well nothing special flavors. For entrees black miso cod great love sweet sauce extremely moist tender fish. The halibut truffle potatoes good ate really heavy rich. The seared sea bass little dry portion smaller compared entrees. The New York steak black bean sauce winner night me. The steak perfect medium rare dry New York cuts be. The sauce paired well steak I subbed mash potatoes garlic noodles good call. I would definitely try steak special still menu!My friend highly reccomended House I excited try it! The salmon wasabi noodles yummy. I got salmon medium perfect flakey. The udon noodles also perfect wasabi sauce spicy enough, hot! The slaw gave nice texture every bite. Delicious lunch! My boyfriend enjoyed curry noodles, said flavorful. The strawberry rhubarb crumble ala mode good, I wanted something pizzazz Asian flare. It good though. Really yummy Asian fusion lunch spot.Came boyfriend said one favourite places. Definitely recommend making reservations since quite busy Sunday night around 7pm. We got seated right away ladies quite efficient. The restaurant smaller side little cramped inside. We ordered two specials day ahi tuna poke soft shell crab. The poke really yummy, fish fresh right amount sauce. The soft shell crab quite different (you literally eat shell) came cold noodles. We also got scallops & sea bass. I found fish well marinated flavourful however noodles green beans little oily & salty taste. Would come back I area would recommend since one better fusions places I've to.I used come often lunch I worked nearby. It MUST everyone! They best sea bass, comes garlic noodles garlic green beans, cooked perfection (slightly salty, I'll take extra water weight day!). For reason, I've disappointed dish dinner I came back lunch today town friend. Delicious!! They took reservation 2 phone even though Yelp reservations offer time. Highly recommend. Great option town guests. Of course North Beach there's parking. Bart Embarcadero walk Uber here. It small place I recommend reservations too.Obviously, The House need another review, seem fine 4500+ reviews average 4.5 stars.However, VEGAN like wondering eat anything VEGAN menu, helpful review day.The menu changes pretty regularly try incorporate fresh & seasonal ingredients. However, meat-centric.However, menu Vegan option ask for. The night I went, offered cold soba noodle vegetable dish hot rice dish.I opted rice dish. They made delicious stir fry tofu vegetables spicy wasabi sauce. I loved sauce most, perfect amount spiciness, overall savory. The portion size bad-it got full, might've due glasses wine I enjoyed.As vegetarian/vegan, I recommend coming own. The veggie dish slightly lower price meat dishes (~$18-20 dish compared $20-40+ meat dishes), still pretty pricey is. There really appetizers vegan-friendly either.Don't come atmosphere either. There's usually always wait small restaurant, expect stand outside waiting, get crammed small seats people brushing past time walk narrow aisle.However, come group decides eat want miss social function. The vegan dish tasty still well made still get understanding everyone raving place.Random last note/Rant: My table ordered tempura green beans literally dumbest plating ever. They hide sauce green bean! So everyone sitting munching away dry tempura wishing provided sauce halfway done dish discover small ramekin sauce bottom.It's literally stupid got irrationally angry restaurant would think that's appropriate way plate dish./rantis favorite Thai restaurant.

Very friendly staff, ordered steak noodles. Thoroughly enjoyed meal. -BCelebrating friend's birthday. Actually first time here, came around 6pm, wait. We ordered two special appetizers three main: grilled sea bass, prime angus ribeye New York steak. Everything good here, great service food delicious.I looking forward place reading great reviews resoundingly disappointment. Nothing terrible nothing spectacular even memorable. The fried salmon roll beautiful little oily lacking flavor really doused soy miso dip. The grilled eel avocado appetizer seemed made frozen eel buy h mart put sushi rice, really nothing special mushy I thought frozen package. I'd rather imagine avocado sushi roll standard sushi place instead. The clams red curry sauce fine good wedges garlic bread unmemorable. The grilled shrimp salad fine unmemorable. Service fine.
